We can create a program using Text Editor (Notepad) or IDE (NetBeans)

class Test
{
    public static void main(String []args)
    {
        System.out.println("My First Java Program.");
    }
};

containing byte code of the program.

• Running the program
We need to use the Java Interpreter to run a program.

Java is easy to learn, and its syntax is simple and easy to understand. It is based on C++ (so easier for programmers who know C++).

The process of Java programming can be simplified in three steps: 

Create the program by typing it into a text editor and saving it to a file – HelloWorld.java.
Compile it by typing “javac HelloWorld.java” in the terminal window.
Execute (or run) it by typing “java HelloWorld” in the terminal window.
The below-given program is the most simple program of Java printing “Hello World” to the screen. Let us try to understand every bit of code step by step.


// This is a simple Java program.
